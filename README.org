* mlpade

MATLAB functions for Pade approximations of the Mittag-Leffler function, E_{\alpha,\beta}(-x).

These approximations, R_{\alpha,\beta}^{m,n}(x) \approx E_{\alpha,\beta}(-x), are only valid where:
+ 0 \lt \alpha \le 1
+ \alpha \le \beta 
+ x \ge 0

This is just an implementation of:

* Using the library

You only have to use ~mlp.m~. Check the documentation for that file to see how to use it.

The other files are the actual implementations of the approximants, which do no sort of input checking/sanitizing and won't throw errors or warn you if you misuse them.
