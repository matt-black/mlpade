* mlpade

MATLAB functions for Pade approximations of the Mittag-Leffler function, E_{\alpha,\beta}(-x) and its inverse.

These approximations, R_{\alpha,\beta}^{m,n}(x) \approx E_{\alpha,\beta}(-x), are only valid where:
+ 0 \lt \alpha \le 1
+ \alpha \le \beta 
+ x \ge 0

This is just an implementation of:

* Using the library

There's really only 2 functions you need to use:

~mlp.m~  : Mittag-Leffler function, E_{\alpha,\beta}(-x)
~imlp.m~ : inverse of Mittag-Leffler, -L_{\alpha,beta}(y)

For how to use them, see the docs in each file.

The other files are the actual implementations of the approximants, which do no sort of input checking/sanitizing and won't throw errors or warn you if you misuse them.
